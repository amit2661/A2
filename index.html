			<h2>Subtheme: Speculation</h2>

			<h3>Dataset Description- Residential sales data in the City of Boston, 2000-2023</h3>

			<div class="dataset-description" style="text-align: justify;">
				
				<p>This dataset, released as part of the <em>Homes for Profit</em> report by the
				Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC), provides over 20 years of real estate transaction
				 data in the City of Boston area. It captures information on property sales, 
				 ownership patterns, investor activity, and financial details, making it a valuable resource 
				 for analyzing speculation and its effects on the housing market.</p>
				
				<p>The key features in the dataset can be categorised as: </p>
				<ol>
					<li>Property Characteristics</li>
					<li>Transaction Information</li>
					<li>Speculation and Investment Indicators</li>
					<li>Financial Metrics & Profitability</li>
				</ol>
				
				<p> This dataset gives us useful insights into tracking investor-driven price increases and assessing the
					impact of cash sales, identifying absentee ownership and mapping speculation hotspots. <br>
					However, there are
					limitations with respect to large number of Null values (intentionally retained in Figure 1), lack of clarity between fields year and yearbuilt and unclear acronyms like RCD in property type. There are also
					contextual factors such as zoning laws, and investor related nuances which require additional data processing.
				</p>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol style="text-align: justify;">

				<li>How does investor-driven speculation impact long-term homeownership rates in Boston?
					<br>Motivation: After reading the Homes for Profit report, I realised that
					Boston has seen a decline in % homeownership, particularly among middle- 
					and lower-income residents. Investors who buy and sell homes frequently may be 
					preventing long-term homeownership by keeping properties in constant turnover rather
					than allowing families to settle. Examining trends in investor ownership versus 
					individual ownership can help determine whether speculative activity is making it 
					harder for residents to own homes and have a decent lifestyle.	
					</li>
				<br>
				<li>Do cash sales contribute to speculation and displacement in Boston’s housing market?
					<br>Motivation: The Indian real estate market greatly slumped in 2016 when demonetisation 
					was introduced. This proved the effect of cash sales (including on my pre-owned property).
					Seeing the large number of foreign investors from the story Reckoning with Boston’s 
					Towers of Wealth, drives me to explore the magnitude of this issue in US 
					(Boston) market.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Are speculative investors targeting certain property types more than others, and what
					does this mean for housing diversity?
					<br>Motivation: It is important 
					to examine which types of housing are most affected. Are investors mainly flipping 
					single-family homes, multi-family units, or condos in high-rise buildings? If speculation 
					is disproportionately affecting multi-family properties, this could be reducing affordable
					rental housing stock. Understanding which property types investors target can shed light 
					on how speculation reshapes the housing supply and whether it worsens affordability for 
					renters versus prospective homeowners. This will help plan a solution to the housing 
					crisis better.</li>
				<br>
				<li>How does the presence of corporate and absentee owners correlate with neighborhood-level
					rent increases and eviction rates?
					<br>Motivation: The high rent for students and residents in the Cambridge area and being part of the 
					affected group, makes me wonder if speculative investors, especially absentee owners and 
					large corporations in the area, may contribute to these trends.
					By analyzing the overlap between corporate ownership, absentee landlords, 
					and areas experiencing high rent increases or evictions, we can uncover to what extent  
					speculation is driving housing instability.</li>

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

			<h3>Data Quality Analysis</h3>
			<p>To thoroughly assess the data quality of the residential sales dataset, 
				I looked at evaluating multiple aspects, including completeness, accuracy, consistency, 
				uniqueness, and validity. Following visualisation better explain the dataset's quality.</p>
				
			<figure>
				<img src="Capture 1.PNG" alt="" style="width: 1200px; height: auto;"/>
				<figcaption>
					This bar chart shows the total price of properties for different style categories. The bars have been further colour coded to investigate what type of buildings do the investor most invest in. As we can see, this dataset has a large number of NULL values probably for properties which either do not fall under a typical style or have not been categorised properly. And most of these proprties have been invested in by institutions. The other categorised properties are majorly invested in by small and non-investors which indicates a democratic distribution.  We can also see very few contemporary, duplex, colonial, or decker houses built in the city. Some conclusions are intuitive like duplex are less common in the city while others are elusive. Hence, two further questions regarding data distribution arise: (1) what are the other features of these NULL records? Were these bought in cash? etc (2) Have the contemporary houses been categorised as Condo, low rise and such subcategories? We will get back to these queries later in the article.

					It is very important to develop an initial judgment of how the prices of residences have appreciated over the years in Boston. This chart illustrates the total price of Residential sales each year over the period 2000-2022. It brings out an intersting fact (contrary to expectation from reading the articles) that most of the properties were not flipped within the a period of two years of sale. Terms of flip are: short (< 6 months), medium (6 - 12 months), and long (12-24 months) term flips. This drives me to further explore what is the magnitude of flipping activity? And how much of it is in cash? Let's see Figure 3. We also notice a dip in sale prices in 2009 corresponding to recession period.

					Flipping activity is defined as buying and selling the property in a short duration to make capital gains (for this dataset the perioad is 2 years). This plot uses a common timeline to show three important aspects related to flipping activity. <br>1. What % of total owned properties were flipped? <br>2. What was the average flip horizon (in days)?- calculated field.<br> 3. How many of these flip transactions were carried out in cash? <br>
					Year 2000 has been excluded because that is the beginning of analysis. We can see that the activity of flipping was not very popular in 2000-2010 era. But after the global recession passed, flipping saw a sharp increase in popularity maximising around 2013 and then seeing a progressive decline. The flip horizon curve, more or less, goes with this trend. Also, the flipping activity increase was accompanied by more sales in cash which is not a characteristic behaviour of middle/ lower class home owners.
					<br> This makes us wonder if all the areas in Boston have been equally impacted by flipping trend which has been explored in Figure 4.

				<figcaption>
				The hotspots of the flipping activity stand out in this map (zoomed in to show only the significant zone). We can notice that Back Bay area has seen the maximum number of flips, followed by South Bay and Beacon Hill. Interstingly, there is no data of Cambridge but that may be prone to flipping as well. Even if these areas are the hotspots, does this have a direct effect on the affordability of residential houses. Let's explore this in the next figure.

				<figcaption>
				This visual plots the median price of the houses in different areas over the period 2000-2022. Median prices were chosen over sum or average beacuase this statistical parameter is more resilient to outliers and skewed data, better represents affordability and is more stable over time. <br> Strangely, it seems initially that the peaks in this plot do not correlate to the map at Figure 4. This may be because the median price has seen major fluctuations near Financial district(02205) and Seaport area (02210) while other areas have witnessed a constant growth.
				<br> But if we closely look at the zip codes on the right which are arranged in the descending order of median price, we notice that the highlighted zip codes in the list appear in the same order as Figure 4. Does it have an indirect correlation??

				<figcaption>
				The graph illustrates how there has been an increase in the number of residential propert owners over the period 2000-2022 in Boston. It is evident that most of the current owners are non-investors while the investors are majorly from the subcategory 'institutions'. There was a distinct jump in the number of no-investor owners from 2020 to 2021. Since, this was during the Covid pandemic times, new constructions could not have been completed. So, it can be speculated that the lockdown prompted people to invest their savings in houses or there were fewer transactions in 2019 & 2020 which cummulated to 2021.

				<figcaption>
				In this plot, we see how the properties in Boston are constructed in terms of numbers of bathrooms and bedrooms in a property. This specifically brings our attention to data quality and the outliers and the rlationship between the parameters. We observe that the property area (in sqft) may be small even for large number of bedrooms. Some properties have bathrooms with no bedrooms. There is a small property with 12 bedrooms which is unlikely. Still, the number of rooms tend to increase proportionally with property area and so do the bathrooms.

			<p> With the available field 'Lasqbin' which included areas of property in the format 1001:1100; it was split into upper and lower bound. The upper bound was used to create a new calculated field which was subsequently binned in to bins of 1000 sqft to get a reasonable idea of the sizing of the real estate.
